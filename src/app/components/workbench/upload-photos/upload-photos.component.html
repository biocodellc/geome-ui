                <p class="valid-hed1">There are two primary methods for uploading photos to GEOME described below. Changing photos involves removing photo metadata from your expedition and the "re-loading" your expedition. For detailed instructions about this process refer to "User Help", located under the gear icon menu in the upper right hand corner of your screen.</p>
                <p class="valid-hed1"><strong>OPTION 1: Upload metadata that references images that are already online.</strong></p>
                <p class="valid-hed1">This option is used when your photos are already accessible online. You simply need to load a CSV file telling GEOME where these photos are located along with relevant metadata. Goto Workbench->Load Data and select the sample_photos_csv or the event_photos_csv option.</p>
                <ul class="first-list">
                    <li>You can upload photos on a project by project basis</li>
                    <li>If your photos span multiple expeditions, select “multiple expeditions” in the expedition code option and specify the expeditionCode in the upload file.</li>
                    <li>Fields to include in the CSV file:</li>
                    <ul class="second-list">
                        <li>photoID (May be required. A good idea to specify this so you can update photos using the ID later.).</li>
                        <li>originalUrl (required. URL location of photo that GEOME will obtain)</li>
                        <li>expeditionCode (required if photos span multiple expeditions)</li>
                        <li>other fields (see photo fields under "Generate Template")</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p class="valid-hed1"><strong>OPTION 2: Upload photos from your hard-drive.</strong></p>
                <p class="valid-hed1">The GEOME bulk image loader accepts a directory of images zipped into a single file. The max file size is 2GB. If you need to upload more than that, split the upload into multiple uploads. The image loader should be able to accept multiple formats, however, the JPEG format is the most reliable format when uploading. When uploading images, you have the following options:</p>
